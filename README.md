The Able to Include Apps and software can only operate and have value, as long as the Able to Include online services are available. So the IPR management of the Services must balance
Availability of the services, to reassure and encourage users and the Open User Community to use the services in their Product Apps
Enable the Service Providers to earn revenues to continue to provide, maintain and scale-up those online services into the future.
To achieve this balance the Providers of the Able to Include Services have agreed to provide the following services with a FRAND (Fair, Reasonable, And Non-Discriminatory) policy to encourage the Open User Community to use the Able services in their Product Apps:
Accessibility Layer Open API Service (described at http://able-to-include.com/accessible-services/accessibility-layer/)
Text2Picto and Picto2Text services (described in D3.1 “Report on the integration of Wai-Not in the Accessibility Layer” at http://able-to-include.com/public-documents)/) 
Simplext service (described in D3.2 “Report on the integration of Simplext in the Accessibility Layer” at http://able-to-include.com/public-documents/) 
Text2Speech local and online services (described in D3.3 “Report on the chosen text-to-speech solution and its integration in the Accessibility Layer” and D4.2 “Report on the deployment, activities and results of the pilot”, at http://able-to-include.com/public-documents/) 
 
The FRAND policy adopted by their Service Providers is as follows:
Third-party beneficiaries of the Able to Include FRAND policy, are entitled to expect that each Able to Include Service:
Is provided and used only on an "As Is" basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied, unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing.
Will continue to be thus provided for at least 2 years after the Able to Include project ends.
Is provided on a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory basis to all users who wish to use it. 
The service is available free for Partners’ research, training and private use. 
Commercial and external research users’ fees for use of the service will be based on rates that:
Provide the Service Provider with an adequate incentive to be able to continue investing and contributing to the service in future time periods.
Are based on a common approach, 
Are not anti-competitive and are reasonable even if no other alternative similar service exists.
Documentation, support and communications with the Service Provider is through http://Able to Include.com only.
